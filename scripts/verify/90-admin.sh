# M6 admin — SHIP-149, the append-only audit log.

# Sourced by scripts/verify-foundation.sh; see 00-stack.sh for what the runner provides.

# Pulled a long way forward of the rest of M6 deliberately: an audit trail cannot be backfilled,
# so it exists before there is anything privileged to record.

ticket "SHIP-149  the audit log is append-only in the database, not by convention"

# -q matters here and only here. Without it psql appends the command tag to the result, so
# this captures "<uuid>\nINSERT 0 1" rather than a uuid — and the two checks below then fail
# with `invalid input syntax for type uuid` instead of with the append-only trigger, which
# their `if` cannot tell apart from success. Both reported a pass while exercising nothing.
# The other captures in this file are SELECTs, which emit no tag under -tA.
